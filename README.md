# GTC ML Project 1 - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Challenge

## Overview
This project focuses on transforming a raw hotel bookings dataset (`hotel_bookings.csv`) into a clean, machine-learning-ready format. The goal is to build a robust data preprocessing pipeline for predicting booking cancellations, which significantly impact hotel profitability. Note: This project emphasizes data preparation onlyâ€”no model building is required.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to identify data quality issues.
- Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, outliers, and data types.
- Engineer new features and encode variables.
- Remove data leakage and prepare train/test splits.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (tested with 3.12)
- Libraries: Install via `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for running the analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies --> pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open `gtc_ml_project1.ipynb`.
4. Run cells sequentially to perform EDA, cleaning, feature engineering.
5. Outputs include visualizations and cleaned dataset saved as CSV file.
